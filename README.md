# Ayu Dark Lighter theme for Visual Studio Code

Based on [Ayu Dark (Bordered)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=teabyii.ayu) theme.

Some UI elements are slightly lighter for better visibility than in the original theme.

The theme does not contain Ayu File Icons. I recommend using [Material Icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme).

## Install

```shell
ext install ayu-dark-lighter
```

Then go to `Preferences > Color Theme > Ayu Dark Lighter`.
